# Unity3D_AutoSnapping
This is an automated snapping tool for Unity3D.

I wrote this for the sake of actually having the option to toggle snapping.

## Installation
place the AutoSnap.cs file in a folder called "Editor" in the root of your project.

## Usage
in the "Edit" menu under the "Snap settings..." option you'll find the "AutoSnap settings..." option.

## Notes
In order to function the autosnap window actually needs to be open. Thus I personally recommend docking it somewhere unobtrusive.
